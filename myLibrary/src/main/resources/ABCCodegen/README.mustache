# IAF Swagger, Jersey 2, Jetty generated server

## Overview
This custom server was generated based off of the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project. This server uses the [JAX-RS](https://jax-rs-spec.java.net/) framework.

To run the server, please execute the following:

```
mvn clean package jetty:run
```

You can then view the swagger listing here:

```
http://localhost:{{serverPort}}{{contextPath}}/swagger.json
```

Note that if you have configured the `host` to be something other than localhost, the calls through
swagger-ui will be directed to that host and not localhost!
